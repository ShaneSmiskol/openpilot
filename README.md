Dynamic Lane Speed (0.7)
=====

This is an experimental branch exploring a possibility of an adaptive/dynamic set speed that will reduce your speed when cars in other lanes are going significantly slower than you, if you don't currently have a lead to slow you down

> What if we got all the radar points (up to 16 for Toyota I believe), only cared about the ones that are within a margin of our speed and if the average is lower than us by another margin, reduce speed to the average of the cars around us? Or maybe the average of the... average and our initial set speed
