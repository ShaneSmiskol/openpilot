Dynamic follow (3 profiles)
-----
Dynamic follow aims to provide the stock (Toyota) experience of having three different distance settings. Dynamic follow works by dynamically changing the distance in seconds which is sent to the long MPC to predict a speed to travel at. Basically, if the lead is decelerating or might soon, increase distance to prepare. And if the lead is accelerating, reduce distance to get up to speed quicker.

Dynamic follow works if openpilot can control your vehicle's gas and brakes (longitudinal).

Just use the button on the button right of the screen while driving to change between these profiles:
  * `traffic` - Meant to keep you a bit closer in traffic, hopefully reducing cut-ins. Always be alert, as you are with any driving assistance software.
  * `relaxed` - This is the default dynamic follow profile for casual driving.
  * `roadtrip` - This profile is for road trips where you're mainly on two lane highways and don't want to be following particularly closely; at night for example.
  * [`auto`](https://github.com/ShaneSmiskol/auto-df) - The auto dynamic follow model was trained on about an hour of me manually cycling through the different profiles based on driving conditions, this mode tries to replicate those decisions entirely on its own.

Dynamic gas
-----
Dynamic gas aims to provide a smoother driving experience in stop and go traffic (under 20 mph) by reducing the maximum gas that can be applied based on your current velocity, the relative velocity of the lead, the acceleration of the lead, and the distance of the lead. This usually results in quicker and smoother acceleration from a standstill without the jerking you get in stock openpilot with comma pedal (ex. taking off from a traffic light). It tries to coast if the lead is just inching up, it doesnâ€™t use maximum gas as soon as the lead inches forward. When you are above 20 mph, relative velocity and the current following distance in seconds is taken into consideration.

All cars that have a comma pedal are supported! However to get the smoothest acceleration, I've custom tuned gas curve profiles for the following cars:

pedal cars:
  * 2017 Toyota Corolla (non-TSS2)
  * Toyota RAV4 (non-TSS2)
  * 2017 Honda Civic
  * 2019 Honda Pilot

non-pedal cars:
  * None yet

If you have a car without a pedal, or you do have one but I haven't created a profile for you yet, please let me know and we can develop one for your car to test.

~~*TODO: Need to factor in distance, as it will not accelerate to get closer to the stopped lead if you engage at ~0mph far back from the lead.*~~ Update: Added lead distance into dynamic gas, now just need to tune and test.

Long control uses a PID loop
-----
I've added a custom implementation of derivative to the PI loop controlling the gas and brake output sent to your car. Derivative (change in error) is calculated based on the current and last error and added to the class's integral variable. It's essentially winding down integral according to derivative. It helps fix overshoot on some cars with the comma pedal and increases responsiveness (like when going up and down hills) on all other cars! Still need to figure out the tuning, right now it's using the same derivative gain for all cars. Test it out and let me know what you think!

Customize this fork (opEdit)
-----
This is a handy tool to change your `opParams` parameters without diving into any json files or code. You can specify parameters to be used in any fork's operation that supports `opParams`. First, ssh in to your EON and make sure you're in `/data/openpilot`, then start `opEdit`:
```python
cd /data/openpilot
python op_edit.py  # or ./op_edit.py
```

Features:
- You can misspell parameter names and opEdit should be able to figure out which parameter you want. Ex. `cmra off` would be parsed as: `camera_offset`
  - You can also still enter the corresponding parameter index while choosing parameters to edit
- Type `a` to add a parameter, `d` to delete a parameter, or `l` to toggle live tuning only mode
- Shows a detailed description for each parameter once you choose it
- Parameter value type restriction. Ensures a user cannot save an unsupported value type for any parameters, breaking the fork
- Remembers which mode you were last in and initializes opEdit with that mode (live tuning or not)
- Case insensitive boolean and NoneType entrance. Type `faLsE` to save `False (bool)`, etc
- **Parameters marked with `(live!)` will have updates take affect within 3 seconds while driving!**

Here are the main parameters you can change with this fork:
- Tuning params:
  - `camera_offset` **`(live!)`**: Your camera offset to use in lane_planner.py. Helps fix lane hugging
  - `steer_ratio` **`(live!)`**: The steering ratio you want to use with openpilot. If you enter None, it will use the learned steer ratio from openpilot instead
  - `enable_long_derivative`: This enables derivative-based integral wind-down to help overshooting within the PID loop. Useful for Toyotas with pedals or cars with bad long tuning
- General fork params:
  - `alca_nudge_required`: Whether to wait for applied torque to the wheel (nudge) before making lane changes
  - `alca_min_speed`: The minimum speed allowed for an automatic lane change
  - `upload_on_hotspot`: Controls whether your EON will upload driving data on your phone's hotspot
  - `no_ota_updates`: Set this to True to disable all automatic updates. Reboot to take effect
  - `disengage_on_gas`: Whether you want openpilot to disengage on gas input or not
- Dynamic params:
  - `dynamic_gas`: Whether to use [dynamic gas](#dynamic-gas) if your car is supported
  - `global_df_mod` **`(live!)`**: The modifer for the current distance used by dynamic follow. The range is limited from 0.9 to 1.1. Smaller values will get you closer, larger will get you farther
  - `hide_auto_df_alerts`: Hides the alert that shows what profile the model has chosen
  - `dynamic_follow`: *Deprecated, use the on-screen button to change profiles*

A list of parameters that you can modify are [located here](common/op_params.py#L40).

Dynamic lane speed
-----
*This feature is disabled until I can figure out how to improve it. Probably going to be replaced by comma's upcoming end 2 end long model.*

This is a feature that reduces your cruising speed if many vehicles around you are significantly slower than you. This works with and without an openpilot-identified lead. Ex.: It will slow you down if traveling in an open lane with cars in adjacent lanes that are slower than you. Or if the lead in front of the lead is slowing down, as well as cars in other lanes far ahead. The most it will slow you down is some average of: (the set speed and the average of the surrounding cars) The more the radar points, the more weight goes to the speeds of surrounding vehicles.

Custom wheel offset to reduce lane hugging
-----
***Update**: The performance of this modification is iffy at best, but it definitely is more apparent than just tuning your camera offset value. Removing the immediate angle offset can have some weird oscillating effect when it's windy or on roads with camber (slant to one side). Will be left in, but disabled by default.*

With the `LaneHugging` module you can specify a custom angle offset to be added to your desired steering angle. Simply find the angle your wheel is at when you're driving on a straight highway. By default, this is disabled, to enable you can:
- Use the `opEdit` class in the root directory of openpilot. To use it, simply open an `ssh` shell and enter the commands below:
    ```python
    cd /data/openpilot
    python op_edit.py
    ```
    You'll be greeted with a list of your parameters you can explore, enter the number corresponding to `lane_hug_direction`. Your options are to enter `'left'` or `'right'` for whichever direction your car has a tendency to hug toward. `None` will disable the feature.
    Finally you'll need to enter your absolute angle offset (negative will be converted to positive) with the `opParams` parameter: `lane_hug_angle_offset`.
    
    The lane hugging mod is enabled only if `lane_hug_direction` is `'left'` or `'right'`. **Warning: the learned steering offset from openpilot will no longer be used if this mod is active.**

Automatic updates
-----
When a new update is available on GitHub for this fork, your EON will pull and reset your local branch to the remote. It then queues a reboot to occur when the following is true:
- your EON has been inactive or offroad for more than 5 minutes.

Therefore, if the EON sees an update while you're driving it will reboot 5 minutes after you stop your drive, it resets the timer if you start driving again before the 5 minutes is up.

Quick Installation
-----
To install Stock Additions, just run the following on your EON/C2 (make sure to press enter after each line):

```
cd /data/
mv openpilot openpilot.old  # or equivalent
git clone -b stock_additions --single-branch https://github.com/shanesmiskol/openpilot --depth 1
reboot
```

The `--depth 1` flag shallow clones the fork, it ends up being about 90 Mb so you can get the fork up and running quick. Once you install Stock Additions, [automatic updating](#Automatic-updates) should always keep openpilot up to date with the latest from my fork!

Branches
-----
Most of the branches on this fork are development branches I use as various openpilot tests. The few that more permanent are the following:
  * [`stock_additions`](https://github.com/ShaneSmiskol/openpilot/tree/stock_additions): This is similar to stock openpilot's release branch. Will receive occasional and tested updates to Stock Additions.
  * [`stock_additions-devel`](https://github.com/ShaneSmiskol/openpilot/tree/stock_additions-devel): My development branch of Stock Additions I use to test new features or changes; similar to the master branch. Not recommendeded as a daily driver.
  * [`traffic_lights-074`](https://github.com/ShaneSmiskol/openpilot/tree/traffic_lights-074):  The development branch testing our traffic light detection model [found here](https://github.com/ShaneSmiskol/traffic-lights).

The branches which have a version number appended to them are past archive versions of Stock Additions.
